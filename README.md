Clarity: A Ruby Documentation Server
====================================

Clarity acts as a front end to [the Ruby documentation project](https://github.com/nevir/rb-documentation),
and it's in an infant stage.


Feature Ideas
-------------

* Navigation should be built from the section outlines defined in the docs.

* In-line editing that creates/updates a GitHub pull request under the covers
  to the docs project.

* Commenting on each page; this should probably be persisted by us, not a 3rd
  party like Disqus (comments are a _very_ valuable reference!)
